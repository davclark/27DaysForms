# This file may be used to create an environment using:
# $ conda create -c mmcauliffe --name <env> --file <this file>
# platform: osx-64
# You'll also need to add a conda channel with pyqt5 - google it!

# I don't know how to specify a channel, so for now, you need to add the -c
# mmcauliffe in the command (as specified above)
